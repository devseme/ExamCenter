                <p> We saw the need to restore confidence and hope to student in having a better
                    performance. We have taken hope as somewhat ephemeral concept, and made it practical.
                    Hope is about oneâ€™s ability to achieve goals. It has been linked to greater academic achievement,
                    creativity, and problem-solving skills, as well as less depression and anxiety.</p>

            <h3>Integrity</h3>
            <p>Academic integrity means putting those values into practise by being honest in the academic work
                you do at university, being fair to others, and taking responsibility for learning, and
                following the conventions of scholarship.</p>

            <h3>Creativity</h3>
            <p>Creativity is about applying and interpreting knowledge in an innovative and unique way, and in
                order to do so, students must understand the content in detail, and have the confidence to
                provide their own unique take on it.</p>

            <h3>Accountability</h3>
            <p>Student accountability begins with establishing the right learning environment. ... When students
                feel connected to each other and their teacher, and when they learn that their actions have
                consequences, they are more likely to take responsibility for their behavior and their learning.
