                    <p>Academic integrity means putting those values into practise by being honest in the academic work
                        you do at university, being fair to others, and taking responsibility for learning, and

                    <h3>Creativity</h3>
                    <p>Creativity is about applying and interpreting knowledge in an innovative and unique way, and in
                        order to do so, students must understand the content in detail, and have the confidence to
                        provide their own unique take on it.</p>

                    <h3>Accountability</h3>
                    <p>Student accountability begins with establishing the right learning environment. ... When students
                        feel connected to each other and their teacher, and when they learn that their actions have
                        consequences, they are more likely to take responsibility for their behavior and their learning.
